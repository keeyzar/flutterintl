translate this string and put it into the ARB files
<p>
    1. Will replace the string with the accessor to the translations (currently S, can be configured)
    2. Will add imports, if necessary
    3. Will put a dummy translation first, so that the UI is not blocked
    4. When the translation, in the background, finished, it will replace the dummy translation with the real one
    5. Will call flutter gen-l10n when the dummy has been put into place
